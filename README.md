Using Advent of Code to practise Rust. I'm used to writing terrible Python code in previous AoCs, (so called, Pythonic), but a lot of Rust solutions you see online are very well structured with enums, structs and error checking which is something I definitely need to work on.

I could get to about day 17 I'd say without external help, but after day 17 I started giving up and just copying solutions online, most probably because of a lack of time and effort.
